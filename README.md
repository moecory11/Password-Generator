# Password-Generator
## Description
For this project my motivation was to create a password-generator that operates smooth and clean. This project makes creating a difficult/complex password that incorperates numbers, upper and lowercase letters and special characters a simple task. I learned throught the process of working on this project that setting the parameters and "if" statements to all  work together to complete the final password was much more difficult than expected.
## Installation
To access the HTML, CSS and JS you can got to the GitHub repository for this project:

## Usage
When using this Password Generator you need to begin by clicking the "Generate Password" button. After that you will need to complete the following prompts to specify that types of characters you would like included in your password as well as the length. Once, completed answering all the questions in the prompts you should be provided a password.
